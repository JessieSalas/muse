VThey will beat you up with their fists (speak with they hands) or they will shoot you up (or the gun talk).\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t do no arguin', I let the gun talk\u000a\u000aSo what Meth is trying to say, they won\u2019t handle problems by talking about them, their fists or their guns will handle them.Unlike other rappers that play it safe by rapping about pussy and money, Meth\u2019s lyrics can suit any theme or style he wants without seeming gimmicky.To bite someone\u2019s style is to take it, reproduce it on yourself, and call it your own\u000a\u000aOn a totally unrelated note, Jay Z made hell of a job at biting Nas with his big lips.Clan in the front, let your feet stomp\u000a\u000aThis line is referring to Wu-Tangs song \u201cClan in Da Front\u201d, of their debut album \u201cEnter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\u201d. It\u2019s not really clear why they have the police at their door, maybe because \u201cthey spoke with their guns\u201d, like the line before says.Method Man\u2019s style is so unique that no matter how relevant or irrelevant he could possibly be, his sound would still be recognizable.Kojak was a 1970s police procedural drama. The series is set in New York City\u2019s Thirteenth Precinct. Lt. Kojak displayed a dark, cynical wit and a tendency to bend the rules in order to bring a criminal to justice. Money Back Guarantee was a case in Kojak.Meth\u2019s music is a mindfuck to people into wack, corny rappers. Listening to him is instant knowledge. Also, a reference to Mad Magazine\u2019s Spy vs. Spy comics.While other rappers have faded into obscurity, Meth\u2019s work has been consistent, and in comparison to a lot of other artists, has aged wonderfully.What\u2019s worse than taking a hit right after someone ashy got to it first?A reference to the Wu-Tang\u2019s Killer Bee associates, and also the bee-themed music video for Triumph.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPRKsKwEdUQAs far as Meth\u2019s concerned, he\u2019s not even competing with anyone else. He\u2019s past wanting to prove a point to the rest of the hip hop community.
